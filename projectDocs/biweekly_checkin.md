# Bi‑Weekly Check‑In (2 Questions)

Purpose: keep learning focused on insight and ethics without heavy overhead.

1) Did ethics content change a design or decision in your project these past two weeks? If yes, what changed and why? (3–6 sentences)

2) What is one assumption you tested (or will test next) and how? Include the minimal experiment and an acceptance criterion. (3–6 sentences)

> Attach: updated PIA/telemetry matrix diff if you changed data collection/visibility.
