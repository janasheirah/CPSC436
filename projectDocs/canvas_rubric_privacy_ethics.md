# Canvas Rubric Segment — Privacy & Ethics (10–20%)

Use this text as a rubric section in Canvas.

Title: Privacy, Ethics, and Reciprocity (15%)

Exceeds (A):
- Complete, specific PIA with data inventory, purpose limits, retention, and access controls; clear diffs when changed
- Telemetry decision matrix shows thoughtful minimization; k‑anonymity/jitter decisions justified and implemented
- Reciprocity note demonstrates concrete value returned and audience served
- Evidence of design changes driven by ethics (bi‑weekly check‑in shows decisions and tests)

Meets (B):
- PIA present with relevant fields; retention and access documented; minor gaps
- Telemetry matrix present; some minimization implemented
- Reciprocity note present with a basic plan
- Ethics influenced at least one decision (documented)

Partial (C):
- PIA present but generic; unclear retention/access
- Telemetry matrix shallow; little minimization in practice
- Reciprocity note superficial
- Ethics mentioned but no demonstrated impact on design

Insufficient (D/F):
- Missing or perfunctory PIA; no minimization or governance
- No reciprocity plan; no evidence of ethics affecting design

Notes:
- Graders look for demonstrated impact on design and implementation, not just prose.
- Link to PIA and telemetry matrix from the README; attach diffs when data collection/visibility changes.
