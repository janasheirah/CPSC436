# Ethics ledger v1

Use this ledger to record ethical concerns, affected parties, and mitigations.

| Date | Decision | Impacted parties | Risk | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 02/10/2026 | Automating the "Forgetting" of sensitive documents. | Data Privacy Officers, Stakeholders | **Compliance Breach:** Deleting files that are legally required to be held for 7+ years (e.g., for litigation) could violate regulations. | Integrate a "Legal Hold" metadata tag that bypasses the S3 Lifecycle rule for regulated documents. |
| 02/10/2026 | Automated deletion of original source files after 90 days. | Future Engineers, Compliance Teams | **Irreversible Information Loss:** If the AI summary misses a nuanced technical detail, the original context is gone forever. | Implement a "Safety Factor" check (Claim 2) and a human-in-the-loop override for high-priority project tags before deletion. |
| 02/10/2026 | Relying on AI (Bedrock) to extract safety-critical engineering values. | Future Engineers, Safety Teams, End Users of Engineered Products | **Silent Misinterpretation:** If the AI extracts an incorrect safety_factor or material_type and the original is deleted, downstream engineers could rely on wrong data for structural or safety decisions. | Require validation against a known-value test set before production use (Claim 2 test). Log every AI extraction with a confidence score. Flag low-confidence extractions for human review before the original document is eligible for deletion. |
| 02/10/2026 | Sending proprietary engineering documents to a managed AI service (Bedrock) for summarization. | Engineering Firms, IP Owners | **Trade Secret Exposure:** Proprietary design details, material compositions, and safety parameters are sent to a third-party AI service. Even within AWS, data could be logged or used for model training. | Use Bedrock with data-use opt-out enabled (AWS does not use customer inputs for training). Enforce VPC endpoints for Bedrock calls so data never traverses the public internet. Document the data flow in the PIA. |
| 02/10/2026 | Designing the system to operate without human review of each deletion decision. | All Stakeholders | **Automation Bias:** Over-reliance on automated deletion removes the human judgment safety net. Edge cases (ambiguous documents, multi-language specs) may be mishandled silently. | Implement the legal-hold override (Claim 4) for known edge cases. Publish a weekly deletion report to a dashboard accessible by compliance teams. Maintain the "no deletion without valid summary" guardrail (Claim 3) as a hard gate. |
