# Evidence pack

Store receipts, logs, screenshots, and outputs in this directory.

Maintain evidence/index.json as the manifest of evidence blocks linking claims to artifacts.
Each entry should include a command or procedure, output, timestamp, and commit hash.

Suggested subfolders:
- evidence/receipts/ for deployment receipts, screenshots, and console outputs.
- evidence/logs/ for logs, traces, and metrics exports.
