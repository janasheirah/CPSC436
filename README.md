# Engineering Knowledge Preservation System (CPSC 436C Capstone)

## Overview
This project addresses the tension between **cost efficiency** and **knowledge preservation** in engineering organizations. Large technical documents (CAD exports, compliance reports) become expensive to store indefinitely in the cloud, yet contain critical "lessons learned," safety limits, and material specifications that must be retained.

**The Solution:** An intelligent system that extracts and structures essential engineering knowledge from massive files, allowing the raw, storage-heavy documents to be safely deleted ("forgotten") while preserving the core value.

## Key Features
- **Storage Reduction:** Significantly lowers long-term cloud storage costs by removing bulky raw files.
- **Knowledge Extraction:** Uses AI to identify and structure critical variables (safety limits, materials, design decisions).
- **Automated Lifecycle:** Manages retention and deletion policies based on the value of the information.
